# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm always striving to further my learning and improve my programming skills. This project involves developing a classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with game development concepts such as graphics rendering, user input handling, and game loop management.

The game is a simple yet engaging version of the classic Snake game. Players control a snake that grows in length each time it eats food. The objective is to avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body while collecting as much food as possible to achieve a high score.

To play the game, use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or its own body. Upon losing, players can choose to restart the game or quit.

The purpose of writing this software is to enhance my understanding of game development, practice using Pygame, and explore the challenges of creating interactive applications.
